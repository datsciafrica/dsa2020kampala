  subtype: presentation
  description: "Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) is a multi-institutional initiative using techniques from algorithms, 
  optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from other disciplines, to improve access to opportunity 
  for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities. MD4SG was founded by Rediet Abebe and Kira Goldner 
  in the fall of 2016 as a small reading group. Since its inception, the group — co-organized by Rediet Abebe, 
  Irene Lo, Ana-Andreea Stoica, and Francisco Marmolejo — has also grown into a network of over 1000 participants 
  from 100 institutions and 30 countries who are united by their interest to use an interdisciplinary approach 
  to tackle problems of societal importance. The online working groups have served as a backbone of MD4SG over the years. 
  In this mini-tutorial, we showcase work focused on and relevant to the African continent, as presented by the leaders of 
  the different working groups. 

  Topics:
  Climate change (Lily Xu & Wanyi Li),
  Inequality (Samuel Taggart),
  Developing Nations (Francisco Marmolejo-Cossio),
  Data Economies (Abeba Birhane & George Obaido)
