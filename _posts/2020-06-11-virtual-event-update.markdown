The DSA organization has been closely monitoring the situation with COVID-19 pandemic around the world, and especially Kampala. 
Guided by our desire to keep the participants out of harms way as much as possible, we are organizing a virtual replacement of the Kampala event starting on July 24th. We believe that the DSA community of both part and new participants can still benefit greatly from the virtual event. This event is also a small part of our response to the pandemic, i.e. equipping more people with the relevant data science skills needed to tackle the COVID challenge.

We are working hard to finalize a rich and diverse program and will share the details here. In the meantime, we ask that participants (including those who had applied for the original in-person summer school) to register online <a href="http://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2020kampala/tbd/">here</a>. There will be no additional python tests, although we highly encourage participants to go through relevant introductory materials listed in <a href="http://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2020kampala/schedule/">http://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2020kampala/schedule/</a>

We are also using this platform as a call for abstracts for the workshop part of the program. Abstracts should be 2-4 pages (optional longer papers are ok as well) and cover relevant topics including but not limited to:
- Data Science for the Sustainable Development Goals
- Health care
- Agriculture
- Wildlife conservation
- Disaster response
- Geo-spatial modeling
- Telecommunications data modeling
- Economic monitoring
- New data science and machine learning methods
- COVID related applications
- Language modeling 

The deadline for submission of abstracts is July 10th, 2020
