The next iteration of Data Science Africa meetings will happen between June 22nd and 26th 2020 in Kampala, Uganda.

We are looking forward to your participation in the summer school, field work projects and the workshop.

In the tradition of previous Africa Data Science workshops, a summer school on machine learning and data science will be held prior to the main workshop. This summer school will target graduate students, researchers and professionals working with huge amounts of data or unique datasets.

The summer school will focus on introductory and advanced lectures in data science and machine learning as well as moderate to advanced practical and tutorial sessions where participants will get their hands wet wrangling and munging datasets and applying cutting edge machine learning techniques to derive inference from the data. Lectures will be given by distinguished world renown researchers and practitioners including researchers from Sheffield University, Amazon, Swansea University Medical School, Facebook, Pulse Lab Kampala, the AI and Data Science (AIR) lab-Makerere University, ARM and Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT).

The school will also involve end-to-end tutorial sessions from professionals walking the participants through a real data analytics problem from data acquisition to data presentation.

Some topics of interest include:

* Data Science for the Sustainable Development Goals
* Healthcare
* Agriculture
* Wildlife conservation
* Disaster response
* Geospatial modelling
* Telecommunications data modelling
* Economic monitoring
