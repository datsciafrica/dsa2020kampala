We have been closely monitoring the situation with COVID-19 pandemic around the world, and especially the developments at the intended DSA event site in Kampala. Even though the number of cases have so far been relatively small in Uganda (see [https://www.health.go.ug/covid/](https://www.health.go.ug/covid/)), we have made a decision to no host an in-person event in June in Kampala. We did not take this decision lightly, and are guided by the safety of DSA participants and organizers as well as the communities we interact with. DSA at its core, is all about communities and right now, these communities are being tested by this unprecedented challenge in a way that makes even the short-term future very unpredictable.

What happens now? We are still planning to host a DSA event in Kampala towards the end of the year, with details still being worked out. In addition, we are also working on a plan to host an on-line only event in June as a near-term replacement for the June event.
We are glad that so many participants have already applied to the summer school program, and are working on the next steps of how we can have everyone benefit maximally with the June online event and the later in-person event.
